While loop

8. Write the difference between for loop and do-while loop?


If we know the number of iterations we need we can use food loop and if we do not know the number of iterations we need , we can run the code based on a condition using while loop/


9. Write a program to print numbers from 1 to 10.


public class PrintNumbers {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
            System.out.println(i);
        }
