1.Variables in dynamically typed programming languages can be given any data type at runtime, but those in statically typed programming languages must be specified with a data type at compile time.


2.A variable in Java is a named memory area that houses data of a certain kind.




3.Use the assignment operator "=",  For instance: int x = 10;


4.Java has built-in primitive data types, which are different from objects and are not objects. They consist of double, boolean, byte, short, int, long, and float.


5.In Java, variables, methods, classes, and other program components are assigned names called identifiers. They are not allowed to be Java reserved terms .




6.The Java programming language supports a variety of operators, such as arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /), relational operators (==,!=,, >, =, >=), logical operators (&&, ||,!), assignment operators (=, +=, -=, *=, /=), and more.




7.Increment and Decrement operators add or deduct 1 from the value of a variable. The decrement operator "--" subtracts one from the variable, the increment operator "++" adds one to the variable. Example::
x now equals 6; int x = 5; x++; / x is back to its original value of 5;
